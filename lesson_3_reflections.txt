When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository would make collaboration easier for a larger project
    or if you use multiple computers to work on a project. It would make it
    easier to always have access to the most current version of your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If someone else was working on your code via the remote,
    the new code may have changes that you don't yet want, or they
    may just be too confusing to figure out without in-person
    discussion of the code. This would leave you spending a lot more
    time figuring out the changes that someone else made, instead of
    being able to work on things on your own.
